# AwkwardEngine
An Awkward C++ Game Engine

AwkwardEngine (AE) is some sort of fun project by me. It utilizes SDL to do all the stuff a Game Engine is supposed to do and is probably going to never be finished since its too awkward. I'm going to add some new features whenever I have nothing else to do and maybe someday (TM) its good enough to create a game with it. Who knows..?

Use at your own Risk. May include awkwardness.
